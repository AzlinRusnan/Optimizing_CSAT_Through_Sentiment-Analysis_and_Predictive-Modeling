# <div align="center">Optimizing CSAT Through Sentiment Analysis and Predictive ML Techniques</div>
Project Overview
Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) is a crucial indicator of service quality in organizations. However, understanding the factors that contribute to customer dissatisfaction and predicting negative experiences remains a challenge. This project applies two advanced techniques to address this issue:

Sentiment Analysis – Analyzing customer feedback to determine whether comments are positive or negative.
Predictive Modeling – Using machine learning to classify customer satisfaction levels based on incident-related data.
By combining natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning, this study aims to provide deeper insights into customer feedback and proactively anticipate dissatisfaction. The goal is to enhance organizational response strategies and improve overall service efficiency.

Approach and Methodology
This project integrates sentiment analysis with predictive modeling to improve CSAT classification. The process includes:

Sentiment Analysis: Textual feedback from customers is analyzed and classified as positive or negative to extract insights beyond numerical CSAT ratings.
Feature Engineering: Incident-related variables such as City, Country, and Region are transformed into machine-readable formats.
Machine Learning Models: The study applies the following classification models to predict customer satisfaction:
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
Logistic Regression (Baseline model for comparison)
Evaluation Metrics: The models are compared based on accuracy, ROC-AUC score, classification reports (precision, recall, F1-score), and confusion matrices to determine the best-performing approach.
